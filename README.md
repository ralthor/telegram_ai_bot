# Telegram AI bot
after installing the requirements, we need this `.env` file with the keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=....
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
TELEGRAM_BOT_ALLOWED_USERS=...
TELEGRAM_BOT_PASSWORD=...
```

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_ALLOWED_USERS` is a comma-separated list of telegram user ids. Only this users are allowed to use the bot.
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_PASSWORD` is not usable. (it's after checking for allowed users. I don't know if I want to make it work later or not)
